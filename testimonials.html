			<p>“Lora was a single-mother, which complicated dating. I’m a self-professed “introverted techie” who doesn’t know how to talk to women. “I Do” did the hard work of bringing us together and we’ve been unbreakable ever since. I now have my best-friend, my co-adventurer, my other half and a wonderful family to love and protect. I’ve never been happier. Thanks “I Do” for helping us find our happily ever after.” </p>

			<h2>True Love</h2>

				</aside>
			<p>“I was so shy and skeptical when it came to dating. I’m a professional in my late 40’s and didn’t think love was for me. Boy, was I wrong. Right before making the decision to give up, I decided to give “I Do” Matchmaking a try. I’m so glad I did. I found the most romantic gentleman a girl could ask for. And I met Reggie on my second match. The services were amazing and helped me embrace who I am. They also helped me embrace the love of my life, because I kept thinking “Is this real?” There really are men out there who want to settle down and start a family. “I Do” brought me real love. Thank you!"</p>

			<h2>My Other Half</h2>
			<aside class="icons">
				<img src="assets/images/44.jpg" alt="Forest Couple Photo" class="photos">
			</aside>
			<p>“I never felt so welcomed before. I’ve tried other matchmaking services, but it felt like I was a payment versus a person with real feelings, seeking real love. At “I Do” I always felt like my needs were real and that I’m valued. When I met Mateo, he told me he felt the same way. We have so much in common. But the most important thing we share, our love for each other, is the best commonality a romantic can ask for. Thanks “I Do” for being a friend, confidante, and helping me find my other half.”</p>

			<h2>Happily Ever AFter</h2>

			</aside>
			<p>“Honestly, some days I think she’s still out of my league. Sophia is beautiful, graceful, intelligent and she’s my wife. Before “I Do” I didn’t believe that I deserved a woman like her. The concierge services really did a number on me. I’m a new man, with a new wife and expanding family. I can’t recommend them enough. I’ve told all of my friends and co-workers about your services and even a few strangers. I’ll tell everyone I meet. Many people I’ve met do not like admitting they met their partners online or through dating services, but I am honored to say we met through you. We’ve said “I Do” thanks to “I Do” Matchmaking!</p>
