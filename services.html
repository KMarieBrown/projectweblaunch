			<p>“I Do” is much more than a dating company. We offer full-service matchmaking services, because that’s what it takes to find love. Do you need date ideas? Do you have a hard time reading people or have a lack of discernment? We can help you. We can help you declutter your life and start anew. We can help you with a newfound confidence that a makeover brings. We will help you find and keep the love that brews. And we provide all of this with the help of our trusted partners, who provide safe dating venues. At “I Do” we believe everyone needs love and sometimes you need help finding it.</p>

			<h2>Matchmaking That Works</h2>

			</aside>
			<p>“I Do” is not your old-fashioned matchmaking company. Dating has changed over the years. The way you meet people, the activities you do, the way you look, the way you talk, etc., has all changed. We take your personality traits and the traits you want in a partner and add them to our system. We use an algorithm and our matchmaking gift to match you with potential partners. At “I Do” our members are screened and have the same goal of settling down. This is not a hook-up site. We introduce you to serious, compatible partners with similar lifestyle patterns and goals. We provide date planning services and safe venues. We even provide a limited time of  couple’s counseling to help you access the health of your relationship.</p>

			<h2>Safe Dating Environments</h2>

			</aside>
			<p>Many of our members came to us with fears of getting back on the dating scene after some time away. This is understandable and we provided the services necessary to help them navigate their way through. Some of our members came to us with fears of online dating. “I Do” came up with the idea to partner with local vendors to make sure that our members have a safe venue to attend a date. Until they’re ready, members can meet directly at the partnered locations, which are all well lit and have their own security or consistent patrolling in the area. Our members are background checked and there are certain offenses that will disqualify you from becoming a member. For example, “I Do” does not extend membership to sex-offenders. In addition, we are always looking for new ways to keep our members safe.</p>

			</aside>
			<p>Full-service coaching at “I Do” includes an array of services. For starters, we make sure you are ready and willing to make the leap. We offer makeovers through our trusted make-up artists, hair stylists, and wardrobe stylists. We offer etiquette lessons to help you with dating, such as which utensil to use during meals and how to be chivalrous. After we build your confidence, we make sure your home life is conducive to the dating life-style. We offer home makeovers to declutter and organize a living space or your entire home. We walk you through your top matches and go over reasons why each could be a great or not so great partner for you. We assist with date reservations from making dining reservations to obtaining tickets for events. Need anything else? Just ask!</p>
